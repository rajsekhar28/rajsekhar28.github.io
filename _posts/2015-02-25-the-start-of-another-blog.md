title : The start of another blog
---

I always wanted to have a personal blog where I can rant about software development, tools, design etc. Although, I did started creating new blogs on wordpress, blogger but they never got going more than a single post :( . But after looking at github.io, I felt that this is how I always wanted to write blogs. This'll give me chance to sharpen my web development skills.

About Me
--------

I am a software developer living in Hyderabad, India.


I love building *new things* and I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in technology; software or hardware.

The Beginning
-------------
I'll be writing about anything I think would be useful and will be sharing more about my development *stuff* as time goes on. Until then, thanks for stopping by.
